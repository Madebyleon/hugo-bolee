<p>TEI2022 will host a Graduate Student Consortium aimed at junior researchers currently in postgraduate degree programs (i.e. doctoral programs in research fields, and master’s programs in the arts) in an area relevant for the Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction community. Traditionally the TEI GSC is focused on meeting other TEI graduate students as well as more experienced TEI researchers to exchange perspectives, share experiences and sharpen the research. The theme for TEI 22 is: &ldquo;Making. Things. Think.&rdquo; The conference will examine the design of autonomous things and the impact these technologies will have on our daily life in the future. While submissions on all topics related to TEI are welcome at the GSC, we particularly encourage submissions that address aspects of this theme.</p>
<p>This year’s edition will be a virtual or hybrid event (TBD). The main GSC event is a one-day session on Sunday, February 13th, 2022, during which TEI graduate students present their work to, and discuss their work with each other and a panel of experienced TEI researchers. During the Sunday program the key purpose is to have an informal and interactive discussion about each candidates’ ongoing research, with the intention to help students sharpen its focus.</p>
<p>GSC applicants may be at various stages of their doctoral research or graduate thesis, however they should have a clear understanding of their driving research question, their research approach including preliminary research design and methodology(s) as well as a goal for what they hope to gain by attending the GSC session.</p>
<h4 id="gsc-activities">GSC ACTIVITIES</h4>
<p>The main GSC panel will be held on Sunday, February 13th, 2022. The day will start with a welcome and introduction by the GSC chairs. Then each student will have to present and participate in a group discussion about their work. The day will end with a general discussion and wrap-up.</p>
<p>Please note that (1) registration fees will be waived for all attending GSC participants; (2) physical attendance is preferred but not mandatory.</p>
<h4 id="submission-guidelines">SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h4>
<p>Each applicant should provide a short written paper describing their ongoing research.</p>
<p>The paper should clearly describe the research topic, covering the context and motivation, objectives, and central research questions. Also we require a concise background description and literature review framing the research, a description and rationale of the approach to research design and methodology, and an overview of data collection and analysis methods. If possible and suitable, please also include description of pilot, preliminary or selected results framed in the context of research questions. Finally, the paper should provide a brief timeline that gives insight into the activities done so far as well as in activities planned for the remainder of the PhD research. Please mention the amount of time left.</p>
<p>The selection of GSC participants will be made by the GSC chairs. Accepted GSC papers will be published in the TEI Proceedings and in the ACM Digital Library.</p>
<h5 id="format-requirements">FORMAT REQUIREMENTS</h5>
<p>The submission should be based on the new ACM submission templates and uploaded through the Precision Conference (PCS) system, which will be open in August. (Indication of length: If processed into a 2 column output please try not to exceed 4 pages excluding references)</p>
<p>Note that GSC submissions are not anonymous. Submissions will be reviewed by the GSC chairs and/or selected senior researchers in the field. Confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process and all rejected submissions will be kept confidential.</p>
<h5 id="confidentiality">CONFIDENTIALITY</h5>
<p>Confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until the start of the conference.</p>
<h5 id="submission-process">SUBMISSION PROCESS</h5>
<p>All papers must be submitted electronically via the Precision Conference (PCS) website.</p>
<h4 id="further-information">FURTHER INFORMATION</h4>
<p>More details will be communicated via the TEI website (tei.acm.org). For additional questions, please contact the GSC chairs <strong>Ian Oakley</strong> and <strong>Bart Hengeveld</strong> via <a href="mailto:gsc_chairs@tei.acm.org">gsc_chairs@tei.acm.org</a>.</p>
