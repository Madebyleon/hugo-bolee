<h4 id="general-information">GENERAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>TEI 2022 is the 16th annual conference dedicated to presenting the latest results in tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction. The ACM TEI conference has gained substantial visibility and activity over the past decade. It brings together researchers, practitioners, businesses, artists, designers and students from various disciplines, including engineering, interaction design, computer science, product design, media studies and the arts.</p>
<p>The theme for TEI 2022 is <strong>Making. Things. Think.</strong> , as a reference to Tom Igoe's book &quot;Making things Talk&quot; which addresses the design issues related to the objects (systems and environments) that become increasingly autonomous and are about to enter our daily lives. As designers, artists, educators, and researchers, we find ourselves in need of new tools and processes to research, design, and to realise aesthetic, meaningful, and inclusive interactions.</p>
<p>Topics and application areas are diverse, including: tangible user interfaces, physical interaction design, flexible and shape changing displays, haptic interaction, smart objects and cities, interactive surfaces, augmented and mixed reality, ubiquitous computing, interactive art and performance, social and wearable robotics, hybrid games, embodied cognition and perception, fashion and material design, furniture and architectural design, learning and education, music and sound interfaces, human-augmentation, as well as productivity and creativity tools in domains ranging from scientific exploration to artistic practice. We invite submissions from a wide variety of perspectives: theoretical, philosophical, conceptual, technical, applied, and/or artistic.</p>
<p>The intimate size of this single-track conference provides a unique forum for exchanging ideas and presenting innovative work through talks, demonstrations, posters, art installations and performances, and participation in hands-on studios and theoretical workshops.</p>
<h4 id="contribution-types">CONTRIBUTION TYPES</h4>
<p>Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers that contribute to advancing this rapidly developing field. Authors are encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution and thus there are no maximum (or minimum) length papers. If your research contribution requires only 6, 8, or 12 pages (single column, plus references), please submit a paper of that length. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its length. Papers should be succinct, but thorough in presenting the work. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.</p>
<p>We highlight the following non-exclusive set of contribution types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Artefact:</strong> We welcome submission of research artefacts that advance the state of the art in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction. Artefacts can demonstrate new technologies (e.g., new sensing techniques or algorithms), new forms of input (e.g., novel interaction techniques) or new designs (e.g., provocative or evocative objects, systems or services).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> Tools, approaches and techniques that enable researchers, technologists, designers and practitioners to study, research and work on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction. Methods can include new forms of study design or data analysis, new engineering processes or frameworks that can structure and constrain generative design activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> Explorations, extensions, refutions, instantiations and other developments of and to the theories pertaining to Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction, such as theories of cognition or the mind and designerly theories and conceptual frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empirical:</strong> Studies and data that add to our understanding of Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction by, for example, providing quantitative accounts of salient aspects of human performance or qualitative characterizations of experiences with tangible artefacts and systems. Empirical submissions can detail outcomes from a very wide range of lab, field and online studies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Respecting the diversity of approaches and methods that together make up TEI, each contribution type will be peer-reviewed on its own merits. We seek high-quality work regardless of the specific subdomain or topic and we expect the work to be positioned firmly in, and building on, prior research in our field, in particular wherever relevant referencing work that was presented at earlier TEI conferences.</p>
<p>Accepted submissions of all contribution types will be included as papers in the conference proceedings, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library.</p>

This requires the use of a simplified one-column template for submission, while the final two-column paper has to be <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_master_article_template_instructions.pdf">rendered for publication</a> after acceptance. We strongly recommend using the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/latex-best-practices">LaTeX</a> templates rather than Word. Papers do not have a page limit.
