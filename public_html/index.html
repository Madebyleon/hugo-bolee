<p>TEI 2022 is the 16th annual conference dedicated to presenting the latest results in tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction. The ACM TEI conference has gained substantial visibility and activity over the past decade. It brings together researchers, practitioners, businesses, artists, designers and students from various disciplines, including engineering, interaction design, computer science, product design, media studies and the arts.</p>
<p>TEI 2022, will take place February 13-16 2022, <strong>maybe virtual, maybe hybrid</strong>. We hope to be able to meet you in-person at <strong><a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST</a></strong> in Daejeon in the Republic of Korea.</p>
<h4 id="theme">Theme</h4>
<p>Korea is blessed with a rich material culture that is woven into the fabric of everyday life. Ranging from the tangible food culture with kimchi, bibimbap, and ssambap to the intricate procedures in k-beauty and carefully choreographed dance movements in k-pop that connect music with fans. Korean manufacturers are rapidly innovating and experimenting with specialized consumer products such as the kimchi fridges, LED face masks, and air dressers for garment care. South Koreans are early and fast adopters of technology and have the fastest internet, and Korea has the highest smartphone penetration rate in the world.
As the digital world is penetrating our physical environment faster than ever with self-learning systems that become increasingly connected, autonomous, we as designers, artists, educators, and researchers find ourselves defining new ways of computing in objects and environments. Therefore the theme: <strong>“Making. Things. Think.”</strong> as we want to look into the design of the autonomous everything and the (future) impact on our (daily) life.
While this topic is not new, it is the very core of TEI: bridging computing with the physical world. We think that designing for “autonomy” might require new approaches and a diverse set of skills and tools. The material virtual culture of South Korea provides a good background and new perspective to explore and discuss future challenges (not only technological), and more importantly, the outcomes of the emerging autono- mous everything and how TEI contributes to their development.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Prior to the conference, on Saturday afternoon and night, we invite you to a Seoul maker city tour. Hyun Parke, a Seoul based maker and co-founder of the first Fab Lab in Korea, will guide a group through the downtown Euljiro area and the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sewoon-sangga-sewoon-plaza">Sewoon Sangga (세운상가)</a> building. Sewoon Sangga built in 1970, was recently rejuvenated with skywalks connecting small maker studios and ateliers. The rooftop offers a fantastic view of downtown Seoul, Jongmyo shrine and the Namsan tower. The nearby <a href="http://www.kwangjangmarket.co.kr">Gwangjang food market (광장시장)</a> or <a href="http://www.hiinsa.com/eng/">Insadong (인사동)</a> offer plenty of opportunities to eat Korean food before heading to Daejeon.</p>

<h4 id="venue">Venue</h4>
<p>Korea, land of the morning calm. Now, South Korea, is Asia’s third-largest economy, home of a large maker industry of electronics and vehicles, calm is probably the last thing you will experience.</p>
<p>Daejeon is South Korea’s fifth-largest metropolis with a population of 1.5 million people. Located at the centre of the country, Daejeon serves as a hub of transportation and is at the crossroads of major transport routes. The capital Seoul is about 50 minutes away by KTX high-speed train. Daejeon is arguably not the most exciting city but it did host the Daejeon Expo ’93 and the International Mathematical Olympiad in 2000.
Daejeon has 18 universities including KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Daejeon will introduce the TEI to an enthusiastic audience of academics, corporations, practitioners and governments in Korea.</p>
