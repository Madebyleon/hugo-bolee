TEI offers a diverse **4 day program** from February 13 to February 16. Since an online conference needs to accommodate participation from all time-zones, TEI2022 will mostly take place live during daytime within the Eastern Asia time zone (KST), while providing both live and recorded interactive sessions for American, African and European participants.

After the usual Graduate Student Consortium and [Studios](/2022/attend/studios) on Sunday February 13th, the main conference program will start Monday February 14th with an opening panel and [Keynote](/2022/attend/keynotes). A brief overview of TEI 2022 program is as below. The full interactive program will be available online from a sigchi link soon.
