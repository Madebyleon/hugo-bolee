#### Elisa Giaccardi
{{< keynoteImg "/2022/images/ElisaGiaccardi.jpg" "Elisa Giaccardi">}}
**Elisa Giaccardi** is Professor of Post-industrial Design at Delft University of Technology. Her work is focused on the challenges that a permeating digitalisation means for the field of design. From early digital networks to social media, from the Internet of Things to Artificial Intelligence, her research interests reflect a persistent concern with design as a shared process of cultivation and management of opportunity spaces, and the transformative role technology can play. After pioneering work in metadesign, networked and open design processes, her research currently engages with how digital things today ‘participate’ in design and use in ways that previous industrially produced objects could not, experimenting with novel design approaches that look at computational artefacts as co­-performers of practice, and thus as potential co-ethnographers and co­-designers in the design process.

A TEDx and frequent keynote speaker, Elisa successfully brings together an interdisciplinary background in humanities, digital media, and interaction design. Her work has contributed significantly to the development of post-industrial and post-humanist approaches in the field of design through more than one hundred peer-reviewed conference and journal papers and book chapters, and funded research projects in the domain of memory practices, resourceful ageing, and the future of work. Elisa is director of the MSc program Design for Interaction at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, Associate Editor for Springer HCI, and Coordinator of the [international DCODE Network](www.dcode-network.eu).

**Jinha Lee** is a cofounder and chief product officer of Spatial, a company that is building a holographic meeting platform that allows people to work together from anywhere as if they were in the same room.

Prior to founding Spatial, Jinha created technologies to physically interact with digital data for the past decade: SpaceTop was a pioneering Augmented Reality desktop that allowed people to reach inside the screen. He also created a physical pixel, ZeroN, that levitates and moves freely as his master thesis project at MIT. At Samsung, he led the redesign of Smart TVs, turning screens into a collaboration platform and artistic data visualization. As an advocate for inclusive design, he co-designed Bradley Timepiece, an award-winning tactile wristwatch for the blind. These projects became viral and brought him to the TED stage in 2013. Jinha was named one of the “35 innovators under 35” by the MIT Technology Review , and one of the “32 greatest living designers” by Fast Company, and was named a “Young Global Leader” by the World Economic Forum.
