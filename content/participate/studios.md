#### STUDIOS AT TEI 2022

TEI 2022 invites proposals for one-day Studio activities, which will take place on Sunday February 13, Anywhere on Earth, hosted at KAIST (Daejeon, Korea).

**Studios** are a format unique to the TEI conference, providing researchers the opportunity to deeply engage with the materials, methods and processes used in their research. Traditionally, studios provide hands-on experiences during which participants are introduced to new technologies, materials, prototypes, design approaches, et cetera.

On the **16th anniversary of the TEI conference** , we also want to encourage authors to consider Studios that act as a platform for examining theory and methodology related to tangible, embodied and embedded interaction. We invite researchers from all career stages to discuss and develop a specific topic of relevance to the TEI community. These Studio proposals should contain a clear theoretical grounding around a problem or opportunity, describe a plan for applied engagement with the topic, and highlight how the outcome will provide important insights for TEI researchers and practitioners. Proposals need to clearly specify how such Studio results will be communicated and archived. Please [contact the studio chairs](mailto:studio-chairs@tei.acm.org) for discussing dissemination options at the conference.

TEI 2022 will be a hybrid conference, but studios can be either on-site, hybrid or purely online. For reference, you can check the 2021 accepted Studios [here](https://tei.acm.org/2021/attend/studios/)!

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR MY STUDIO PROPOSAL?**

Well, first of all, you&#39;ll have some more time to complete it. Furthermore: the proposal should reflect on how the Studio will be organised in a virtual/online format. Things to consider are:

- Specify if the workshop will take place at KAIST (hybrid / on-site form). In this case the organization will provide audiovisual equipment and (digital) fabrication tools, electronic workshops, etc.
- What (online) tools and resources can be used?
- How many people can participate?
- How will the studio accommodate multiple time-zones?
- Can or should materials be sent to participants?
- Can participants organize their own materials?
- Does this affect the budget?

If you are unsure how to answer those questions, the Studio Chairs are ready to help you with suggestions. Moreover, this new situation also opens up new possibilities. Consider, for example:

- **Conceptual possibilities:** how can the previously conceived Studio proposal be realised in an online format?
- **Accessibility possibilities:** a much wider audience is now available.
- **Temporal possibilities:** Studios no longer need to take place on Sunday, the 13th of February. In fact, some Studios might benefit from taking place over the course of multiple days or using a partly a-synchronous approach. If this is the case, please specify this in your proposal. The Studio Chairs will work with organisers to create a planning that best fits to the proposed Studios.

Organisers should specify in their proposal how their Studio will take shape virtually or hybridly. We ask organisers to consider practical solutions to dislocation (e.g., mailing out materials to participants, or asking participants to purchase necessary materials) and specify online tools and systems that will be used during the Studio.

Furthermore, we encourage authors to regularly review the TEI website for possible updates around the conference organisation. For any questions and clarifications around the call, the conference, or other things that may influence submission or attendance, always feel free to [get in touch with the chairs!](mailto:stdudio-chairs@tei.acm.org)

#### ORGANISATIONAL

Studio proposals are considered non-archival publications, which means that copyright automatically remains with the authors. Accepted proposals will, however, be made available through the ACM Digital Library.

At least one author of each accepted Studio submission must register for the conference and the studio before the early registration deadline, for the Studio to be included in the conference program and the final submission to be published in the conference proceedings. Studio organisers are expected to recruit participants themselves. A minimum number of registered participants will be required for a Studio to take place. All participants will need to register for the Studio they are attending.

We intend for the Studios to be as accessible as possible and will present alternative registration options for organisers as time progresses. If you intend to submit a proposal and are not funded by a university, feel free to [contact](mailto:studio-chairs@tei.acm.org) us to discuss participation options.

#### SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

##### FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

A Studio proposal consists of two documents: a **description** document and a **logistics** document. The submission document should be formatted according to the new ACM [&quot;Review Submission Format&quot;](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow). The logistics document should be formatted so as to best communicate the organisers&#39; intent for the Studio.

- Abstract
- Detailed proposal description
- Grounding in theory
- Materials to be explored
