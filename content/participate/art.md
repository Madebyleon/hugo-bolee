#### GENERAL INFORMATION

The art and performance track at TEI seeks interactive artworks and performances that articulate and provoke alternative viewpoints to facilitate the discussion around the TEI theme of tangible interaction design.

**We specifically aim for artworks that address the opportunities of hybrid exhibitions that can be experienced anywhere yet have a physical component, as we expect that not all attendees are able to join TEI on site. Topics include but are not limited to:**

- COVID related challenges for art and society.
- Artistic perspectives and critiques of human-machine-interaction
- Questioning established forms of digital-physical interactions
- Experimental materialities and speculative science
- Multimodal experiences provoking all human senses
- Embodiment of digital data and critical data representation
- Physical manifestations of artistic research methods
- Breaking sociotechnical constraints through cultural diversity

We welcome submissions from independent artists, academic researchers, professional practitioners as well as art and science students seeking the opportunity to exhibit/perform their artworks combined with a publication in an established academic research context.

Accepted artworks will be exhibited at KAIST in the Republic of Korea and available/ downloadable / fabricationable anywhere. We do understand that not all artists can join the conference irl (in real life) in that case we will need good instructions on how to set up and run the work.

#### SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

TEI2022 uses [ACM workflow](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow) for submission templates and published papers. This requires the use of a simplified one-column template for submission, while the final two-column paper has to be [rendered for publication](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_master_article_template_instructions.pdf) after acceptance. For further details please follow the provided instructions or contact our Publication Chairs.

Art and Performance reviews are not blind, the submissions should therefore include the author(s) name and affiliation. In addition to the description of the artwork (approx. 2-4 pages in two-column format), applicants must submit a setup information form (technical rider) describing the technical and logistical requirements of exhibiting/performing their work. It is also recommended to submit a short video or other additional review material documenting the artwork, as well as an optional biography and/or portfolio.

Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM digital library. Accepted authors will have the opportunity to submit a higher quality video which will be included in the conference proceedings (and possibly displayed during the conference).

##### SELECTION PROCESS

Submissions will be selected based on their artistic quality and their approach to timely and relevant topics to the field of tangible, embedded, and embodied interactive art.

The virtual, spatial and logistical constraints of the exhibition may determine the eligibility of submitted projects. The review and selection process will be based on the following criteria:

- **Relevance** – The work should be relevant to the TEI community scope.
- **Artistic** – The artwork should be compelling through its significantly formal, conceptual and experiential properties.
- **Tangible** – The work should have a primary tangible and material aspect that engages human interaction beyond conventional screen-pointer interfaces.
- **Computational** – It should involve computational technology (digital, biological, or analog) in some aspect of its form or function.
- **Positioning** – The artwork should be positioned within related areas of theory and/or/practice.
- **Professionality** – The artistic research quality of the submitted paper

##### SUBMISSION PROCESS

All submissions must be made via the **[Precision Conference (PCS) website](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions)**.

##### ATTENDANCE

Accepted artworks will be exhibited during the conference at KAIST. We plan for Monday evening during the reception.

One author of each accepted submission must register for the conference before the early registration deadline in order for the final paper version to appear in the conference proceedings. Authors of accepted submissions only pay the reduced fee for attending the conference, independent artists may apply for a waived registration fee.
