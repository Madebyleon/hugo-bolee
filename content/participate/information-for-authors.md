TEI 2022 will fully switch to the [new ACM workflow](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow) for submission templates and published papers. This requires the use of a simplified one-column template for submission, while the final two-column paper has to be [rendered for publication](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_master_article_template_instructions.pdf) after acceptance. We strongly recommend using the [LaTeX](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/latex-best-practices) templates rather than Word. Papers do not have a page limit.

**Pictorials** must be submitted in the TEI2022 Pictorials format (see below) and not exceed 12 pages, excluding references. The first page of the submission should include the submission&#39;s title, author(s) and their affiliation(s) (leave blank for double-blind review), and a written abstract of no more than 150 words succinctly describing the background and context of the pictorial as well as its contribution to the TEI community. Further written parts known from other conference formats such as Introduction, Conclusion, Discussion, Acknowledgements, and References are optional. The main part of the submission should be an annotated visual composition and we encourage submissions to use the format creatively. All submissions should be anonymous and submitted via the TEI2022 **[Precision Conference (PCS) system](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions)** by August 2, 2021.

We strongly advise you to use the InDesign template to compose your Pictorial. If you do not have access to InDesign, please use the Word or Powerpoint templates.
