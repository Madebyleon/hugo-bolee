TEI 2022 is the 16th annual conference dedicated to presenting the latest results in tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction. The ACM TEI conference has gained substantial visibility and activity over the past decade. It brings together researchers, practitioners, businesses, artists, designers and students from various disciplines, including engineering, interaction design, computer science, product design, media studies and the arts.

#### Theme.

The theme for TEI 2022 is _Making. Things. Think._ , as a reference to Tom Igoe's book "Making things Talk" which addresses the design issues related to the objects (systems and environments) that become increasingly autonomous and are about to enter our daily lives. As designers, artists, educators, and researchers, we find ourselves in need of new tools and processes to research, design, and to realise aesthetic, meaningful, and inclusive interactions.

Topics and application areas are diverse, including: tangible user interfaces, physical interaction design, flexible and shape changing displays, haptic interaction, smart objects and cities, interactive surfaces, augmented and mixed reality, ubiquitous computing, interactive art and performance, social and wearable robotics, hybrid games, embodied cognition and perception, fashion and material design, furniture and architectural design, learning and education, music and sound interfaces, human-augmentation, as well as productivity and creativity tools in domains ranging from scientific exploration to artistic practice. We invite submissions from a wide variety of perspectives: theoretical, philosophical, conceptual, technical, applied, and/or artistic.

The intimate size of this single-track conference provides a unique forum for exchanging ideas and presenting innovative work through talks, demonstrations, posters, art installations and performances, and participation in hands-on studios and theoretical workshops.
