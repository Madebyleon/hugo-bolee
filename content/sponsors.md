Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI) 2022 is a venue for cutting-edge research in interaction design, new technologies and smart materials, user experience, design research, and interactive art. TEI is 100% sponsored by ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and one of the larger SIGCHI (Special Interest Group Computer Human Interaction) conferences.

TEI typically attracts an audience of 300 participants from academia, industry and government. TEI 2022 will be the sixteenth conference and the first TEI in Korea. We build upon a successful tradition of hosting SIGCHI conferences in Korea, such as Mobile HCI, ISS interactive spaces and surfaces and CHI.  

The conference attracts leading thinkers from academia, industry and government, as well as talented early-career researchers and UX (User Experience) designers. Sponsorship is an effective strategy for promoting your organization with target transdisciplinary audiences across tangible interaction, HCI (Human Computer Interaction), material sciences, social sciences, and the arts.

TEI 2022 is offering four general levels of sponsorship (Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze). Each package can be extended to adapt to your needs. For more information, please contact the [Sponsorship Chair](sponsor-chair@tei.acm.org).
